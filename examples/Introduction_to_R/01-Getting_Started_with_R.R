## Getting Started  	

### Some Brief History	
# R followed S. The S language was conceived by John Chambers, Rick Becker,
# Trevor Hastie, Allan Wilks and others at Bell Labs in the mid 1970s. 
# S was made publically available in the early 1980â€™s. R, which is modeled
# closely on S, was developed by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka in the early 
# 1990's while they were both faculty members at the University of Auckland. 
# R was established as an open source project (www.r-project.org) in 1995. 
# Since 1997 the R project has been managed by the R Core Group. 
# When AT&T spun of Bell Labs in 1996, S was no longer freely available. 
# S-PLUS is a commercial implementation of the S language developed by the 
# Insightful corporation which is now sold by TIBCO software Inc.

### How R is oganized	

# R is an interpreted functional language with objects. The core of 
# R language contains the the data manipulation and statistical functions. 
# Most of R's capabilities are delivered as user contributed packages that 
# may be downloaded from CRAN.R ships with the "base and recommended" 
# packages:
